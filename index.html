<h2 style="color:black; text-align:center;"> <u>SAY NO TO ALCOHOL</u> </h2>

<h3 style="color:blue; text-align:left;"> DRINKING ALCOHOL IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH </h3>
<h4 style="color:black; text-align:left;"> • Look the person in the eye.
• In a firm voice, tell the person you don't want to drink
or use drugs. Say something like:</h4>
<ol>
<li>- "No, I'm sorry, but I don't use...." </li>
<li>- "No, I'm really trying to stay clean."</li>
<li>- "No, I'm trying to cut back."</li>
</ol>

<h4 style="color:black; text-align:left;">• Give a reason why you don't want to drink or use drugs.
Say something like:</h4>
<ul>
<li>- "It's bad for my health."</li>
<li>- "I could lose my housing."</li>
<li>- "I have trouble when I use...."</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:black; text-align:left;">• Ask the person not to ask you to drink or use drugs
again. Say something like:
<ol>
<li>- "Hey, I said I'm trying to stay clean, so don't ask me
again."</li>
<li>- "I told you I don't use anymore, so stop asking."</li>
<li>- "I'm trying really hard to stay clean, so please don't
ask me to use anymore."</li>
</ol>

<h4 style="color:black; text-align:left;">• If you notice that someone does have drugs, leave the
area.</h4>
